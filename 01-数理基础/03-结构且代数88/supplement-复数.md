> 为什么扩展$i = \sqrt {-1}$ 就那么容易呢？没有遇到自洽的问题呢？这是因为当人们抽象出“1+1=2”的时候，复数就根植于逻辑之上、存在于数学之中，静静地等待着人们的发现。

> Mathematics  began as a way to quantify our world, to measure land, predict the motions of planets, and keep tracks of commerce. Then came a problem considered impossible. The secret to solving it was to separate math from the real world, to split algebra from geometry, and to invent new numbers so fanciful they are called imaginary.

> It turns out that the Schrodinger equation describes correctly everything we know about the behavior of atoms. It is the basis of all of chemistry and most of physics. **And that square root of minus one means that nature works with complex numbers and not with real numbers.** This discovery came as a complete surprise, to Schrodinger as well as to everybody else.
