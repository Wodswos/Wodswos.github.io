Manuel Blum:

> You are all computer scientists.
> You know what FINITE AUTOMATA can do.
> You know what TURING MACHINES can do.
> For example, Finite Automata can add but not multiply.
> Turing Machines can compute any computable function.
> Turing machines are incredibly more powerful than Finite Automata.
> Yet the only difference between a FA and a TM is that
> the TM, unlike the FA, has paper and pencil.
> Think about it.
> It tells you something about the power of writing.
> Without writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton.
> With writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.

# 碎碎念

可能还是该多看多读多想少记。

记录有收获，但耽搁了太多时间了，也很难沉下心来。
