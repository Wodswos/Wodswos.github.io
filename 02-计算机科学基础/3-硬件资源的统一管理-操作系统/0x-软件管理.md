# Chocolatey

最初是装Node.js的时候手贱，点到了安装Chocolatey，那就索性了解一下。

> Some npm modules need to be complied from C/C++ when installing. If you want to be able to install such modules, some tools (Python and Visual Studio Build Tools) need to be installed.
>
> Automatically install the necessary tools. Note that this will also install Chocolatey. The script will pop-up in a new windows after the installation completes.

Chocolatey是一款专为Windows系统开发的、基于NuGet的包管理器工具，类似于Node.js的npm，MacOS的brew，Ubuntu的apt-get，它简称为choco。

Chocolatey的设计目标是成为一个去中心化的框架，便于开发者按需快速安装应用程序和工具。

```bash
# 列出所有choco管理的、已下载的应用程序
choco list --local
# 列出所有已安装的应用程序，包括不归choco管的
choco list --li
```

如果是一台全新的电脑，倒是可以考虑用chocolatey统一管理各种环境。

## uninstallation

然后就卸了。

> Should you decide you don't like Chocolatey, you can uninstall it simply by removing the folder (and the environment variable(s) that it creates). Since it is not actually installed in Programs and Features, you don't have to worry that it cluttered up your registry.
>
> however that's a different story for the applications that you installed with Chocolatey or manually.[^4]

再然后……因为Hugo，一度想下Chocolatey，但Requirements有一条：

- .NET Framework 4+ (the installation will attempt to install .NET 4.0 if you do not have it installed)(minimum is 4.5 for install from this website due to [TLS 1.2 requirement](https://chocolatey.org/blog/remove-support-for-old-tls-versions))

因为俺只听过但不太懂.NET，搞得我有点不太想下了，至少等我先了解了.NET再说，不了了之。
